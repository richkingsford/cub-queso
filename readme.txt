This app lets you manually control a robot to do a specific job.  Our generation 1 robot uses a single micro servo motor on an arduino uno - pin 5.  The job we'll record again and again is rotating the camera until we find the purple, red, and dark blue dot and then pause on the dot for 1 second and briefly jiggle back and forth and then pause for another 1 second. To signal the start of a job, I should manually hover the center of the camera over the green dot for 2 seconds.  To signal the end of a job, I should manually hover over the pink dot for 2 seconds.  The output of my python code should tell me what colored dots the camera is centered on along with key events (start job, panning [right/left] looking for the [color] dot, end job).
